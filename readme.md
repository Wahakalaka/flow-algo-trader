# Flow Algo Trader

This project is meant to identify and pile on to trades it decides will be profitable, using FA's order flow as input.

Use this at your own risk, it is provided as-is (there aren't even unit tests!), it is not financial advice, if it becomes an accessory to you blowing your account, that is your own fault.
